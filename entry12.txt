Okay, yeah,
that was throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Taking a far less extreme approach - yanking weeds & leaving flowers.

What this means is eliminating all the "legacy code" from when I was
follwing the RLTK tutorial and added a bunch of functionality that I
have no intention of using. At the time it was wonderful practice,
now, it's bloat.

For example, GoblinRL can procedurally generate random maps in like
10 different ways -- and I definitely don't plan on using 9 of them.
So... out it goes.

Some of the flowers are things like being able to use tilesets in place
of text characters, if I want, and being able to render two different
fonts in two separate parts of the terminal window, if I want.
These I do plan on using, and I wouldn't have a clue how to implement
most of it on my own.

So.

Thanks again to bracket-lib & it's writer, Herbert.
