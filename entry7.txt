Well, job hunting is horrible, but what's new?

Well, I'm almost done implementing my idea of what a gui widget *is* into my
game, GoblinRL. It's very fun, actually. At first, I was looking at building
the GUI as a chore, but now that I'm eye-deep in the bantha pudu it's actually
quite enjoyable. I got to write, from scratch, a bunch of OOP concepts I had
previously only read about, and now I'm getting to re-use what I've already
written.

Often requiring minor tweaks to what I'm re-using, but hey, that's HUGE
progress from when I started this project, at which time I was basically
completely re-writing every single thing I ever tried to re-use because I
immediately realized how horrible my implementation was.

I'm finally building an instinct for code architecture in Rust, and it feels

really

decent.

D-E-eecent.

Catch the reference if you can,
from your neighborhood
coding
man.

Bye.
