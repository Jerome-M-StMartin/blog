Today's Topic:
"Oh god, oh god, why did I implement it this way, what was I thinking?"

Followed by a large dose of:
"Oh yeah, that's why."

Bloody hell.

Anyway, almost done mashing my custom GUI crate in with the pre-existing
code-base for GoblinRL. So, so close. All that's left is to re-enable all
the user input options which were available previously, tie them to their
respective systems from the 'old code', and then -- the big nasty job --
cleanup.

And boy howdy does this code need some cleanup, after what I've just
put it through.

Oh and I guess I should liberally sprinkle in some more comments too.

Sincerely,

Jerome "Why Are You Still Reading This Blog" St.Martin
