Okay so this part of the project is basically just studying the bracket-lib
codebase, which is minimally fun, but also somewhat exciting since I'm
essentially learning how to optimize draw call to the terminal.

Thus the lack of commits lately. Also I just haven't been putting in the
hours. Too many job applications taking up my mental. Anyway,

What am I talking about?

So, I gotta back way up for a second. This project, GoblinRL, was begun
back when I was very much in "tutorial hell" in my learning-rust journey.
So I was naively (as a CS term) following bracket-lib's accompanying
roguelike-tutorial as I found my sea legs.

Once I found those legs, I stopped following the tutorial. This was my goal
from the beginning, but what I didn't realize from the beginning was that,
generally speaking, the tutorial IS THE DOCUMENTATION for bracket-lib!

That, or I missed and continue to miss the actual docs.

Which leaves me in a very awkward position right now, because I'm looking at
some old direct-from-tutorial code which writes and renders in a way that is
OBVIOUSLY meant to be re-written in a more performant way.

But I have NO idea how the library wants to be used in this more performant
way. So I'm figuring that out, without documentation.

This isn't a complaint, only an observation. I don't mind much at all,
really; after all, it's temporary struggle. Future jobs with existing
codebases will always have excellent documentation with 100% coverage,
right?

Right?

And he coded happily ever after, The End.
