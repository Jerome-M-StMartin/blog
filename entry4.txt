So, I've got a blindspot, but I am no longer blind to it. It's got a name:
Closures and First-Class Functions.

To be clear, I've been aware of these things for a while, but I didn't
understand them. I've never used them. I've never considered them in my
designs. I aim to change that.

Pretty slow going since I'm so focused on my game rn - it makes starting any
side projects -- no matter how small -- feel like a distraction.

That's all for now.
