Took a visit back down the rabbit-hole of "OO vs Functional Programming",
and again I found no answers, only highlights of facts that I nod my head
at and think, "Yeah, that is a problem."

Overall, I wouldn't describe that time spent as a waste, even if I didn't
arrive at any answers. It's important to keep the pitfals of certain paths
in mind so as to avoid them as best possible.

Though some are simply unavoidable, such as the horrific bloat that OOP
inherently causes. Nounification requires more nounification and sometimes
it gets absolutely brutal to keep track of all the ways in which a certain
noun doesn't quite exactly encapsulate all the behaviour its name suggests
it should.

I am so, so very tempted to say that this must mean that OOP is bad, or
that I've implemented the paradigm incorrectly, but the fact of the matter
is that sometimes an object needs access to data that it, conceptually
speaking, shouldn't really have any business with, if you were to consider
its noun-name only.

So, perhaps I have done it badly, but bad code that works isn't so bad
as the word bad, you know?

Anyway, signing off for now. Godspeed.
