Don't remember what I wrote in my previous post - it's been a minute.
Almost set the repo private until I re-read everthing,
but that felt like a need for control
which I don't have space for right now.

What I do have space for is applying for jobs and writing non-code things.
But, I need to get back to coding GoblinRL. I'm experiencing a lack of vision.
I've just finally got one widget instancing and working as designed, but now
comes the time to make all the HUD widgets and I'm just not sure how I want it
to look. So I haven't been coding much, because

I do this kind of design work on paper. Since the game is comprised of a grid
of cells, graph paper works great. Final versions I do put into digital form,
such as this concept I had for ability/action cards:

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓

┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

I think it looks great - this is one facet of the polgon that represents the
aesthetic of GoblinRL. It's hard to not have a sci-fi vibe in UNICODE-only art.
Which makes me want to pivot to making a Master of Orion 2 derivative instead,
sometimes. But, at this point, I'm excited to know that eventually I'll be
able to make both games off this same foundation of code I'm building now.

The "Rarity" at the bottom-right is not related to NFTs, btw. It's rng rarity.

Shoutout (again?) to the creator of bracket-lib, the library I use to avoid
learning how to effeciently write to the terminal buffer directly, among other
things. I'll probably not implement A* on my own again - then again... maybe a
custom pathing algorithm would be a fun to code.

Anyway,
You should probably stop reading these.
